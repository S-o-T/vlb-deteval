# VLB-Deteval

Source code for *Large scale evaluation of local image feature detectors on homography datasets*. Paper describing this protocol is to be published in BMVC 2018.

This project is based on the VLB projec - VLFeat benchmark - and is written in MATLAB. However, it is possible to run it with MATLAB SDK which is freely avaliable.

Code coming soon.
